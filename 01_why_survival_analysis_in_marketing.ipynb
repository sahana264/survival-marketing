    "## 1. Why Survival Analysis (Time-to-Event-Analysis) in marketing\n",
    "\n",
    "Many marketing questions are **how long until..?**\n",
    "- How long do subscribers stay before cancelling?\n",
    "- How long does it take a free user to **upgrade**?\n",
    "- How long before a shopper places the **next order**?\n",
    "- When will a re-engagement campaign bring a user back?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional churn/conversion models reduce these to a **yes/no** problem within a fixed ime window (e.g, will churn in 90 days?). That throws away timing and ignores people still active.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time-to-event-analysis** - historically called *survival analysis* was developed in **medicine** and **engineering**  to study time until death or time until failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **References**  \n",
    "> • [Wikipedia — Survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis)  \n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Why it's different from simple churn classification\n",
    "\n",
    "A churn classifier asks: *Will this customer churn in 90 days - yes or no?*\n",
    "A survival model asks: *What is the probabaility this customer is still active at any time \\(t\\)?*\n",
    "It keeps customers who are **still active** by marking them as **censored** rather than discarding or mislabelling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets us:\n",
    "- Forecast **retention or adoption curves** over time.\n",
    "- Compare strategies or cohorts fairly.\n",
    "- Plan timings of **offers or interventions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Marketing Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival (time-to-event) analysis is useful well beyond churn:\n",
    "- **Subscription cancellation** - length of paid membership\n",
    "- **Repeat purchase** - time from first to second/third order\n",
    "- **Upgrade timimg** - free -> premium conversion times\n",
    "- **Campaign Response** - how long a user acts after a promotion\n",
    "- **Referral** - time until a customer refers a friend\n",
    "\n",
    "All share the same pattern: **time until an event, with many customers not yet at the event**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Censoring - The Key Data Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when we pull data, many customers haven't yet had the event. \n",
    "Instead of discarding them, we keep them as **censored** :\n",
    "we know they lasted *at least* this long.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each customer $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_i^{\\mathrm{true}}=\\text{actual event time},\\quad\n",
    "C_i=\\text{censoring time},\\quad\n",
    "T_i=\\min(T_i^{\\mathrm{true}},C_i),\\quad\n",
    "\\delta_i=\\mathbf{1}\\{T_i^{\\mathrm{true}}\\le C_i\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe $(T_i,\\delta_i,X_i)$ where $X_i$ are customer features (channel, spend, tenure…).\n",

    "| K        | Free         | Free         | Free         | Still free at Q3 (right-censored at Q3) |\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t know the exact upgrade day for H and I — only that it occurred between the quarterly checks.  \n",
    "This is **interval censoring**: the event is known to have happened *within a time interval*.\n",

    "## 5. Quick Look at a Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the small `rossi` dataset (Rossi et al., 1980; available in [`lifelines`](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples.html)).  \n",
    "It tracks time until re-arrest — structurally identical to many marketing datasets.\n",

    "from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi\n",
    "rossi = load_rossi()\n",
    "rossi.head()\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rossi dataset (Rossi et al., 1980) is a classic survival-analysis dataset on time to rearrest for 432 men released from prison in Connecticut.\n",
    "It records the observed time in weeks (week), whether a rearrest occurred (arrest = 1/0), and covariates such as age, prior convictions, and financial aid status."
